## What will happen?

32 hours of tweaks and information deployment

Put content in odd places, fill mediums with unseen ideas.
Content Hack Day intends to explore, break, twist, and reboot the definition of content as something more than a buzzword: the maximum currency of information.

The aim is that developers, designers, artists and other media-savvy people prototype, glitch and publish different kinds of content across whatever platform they can think of.

We consider important to establish a strong relationship with people that work in our field: spreading human knowledge.

### Why should my company/organisation should participate?

*You want people to use your API in a new funky way

### What kind of projects are you willing/expecting to see happen?

*I would love an app that tells me where iBeacons are located and opt-in/out of them accessing my device
*Using smartphones and becoming devices to explore fiction-based locations in real time to unlock extra content.
*Getting your productivity suites to assist you from your wearables 

### Who owns the IP of the hacks?

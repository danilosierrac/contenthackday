## What will happen?

32 hours of tweaks and information deployment

Put content in odd places, fill mediums with unseen ideas.
Content Hack Day intends to explore, break, twist, and reboot the definition of content as something more than a buzzword: the maximum currency of information.

The aim is that developers, designers, artists and other media-savvy people prototype, glitch and publish different kinds of content across whatever platform they can think of.

## Deeper questions

### *Why are you organising this?*

We consider important to establish a strong relationship with people that work in our field: spreading human knowledge. 

### *Why should I attend?*

Because it is an opportunity to work with new technology in a completely free, cozy environment.

### *Why should my company/organisation should participate?*

* You want people to use your API in a new funky way 
* You want to see what kind of cool integration potential your product has 
* You are curious to see why and where people can put content -You are generous 

### *What kind of projects are would you like to see in the event?*

Anything is welcome, yet when thinking about the event this is what I picture happening:

* Deploying a blog on a watch
* An app that deletes metadata from photos for privacy to exist
* An app that tells me where iBeacons are located and opt-in/out of them accessing my device
* Using smartphones and iBeacon devices to explore fiction-based locations in real time to unlock extra content.
* Getting your productivity suites to assist you from your wearables 

### *Who owns the IP of the hacks?*

Every person who actively works on a project owns that project themselves. 
Your code stays yours.

*Bringing your own hardware is welcomed too!*
